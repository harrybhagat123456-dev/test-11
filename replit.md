# SAINI DRM Bot - Telegram Text Downloader Bot

## Overview
This is a Telegram bot that can extract videos and PDFs from text files and upload them to Telegram. It includes DRM support with a minimum quality of 360p and features a Flask web interface.

## Project Structure
- **Flask Web App (Frontend)**: Runs on port 5000, displays bot information
- **Telegram Bot (Backend)**: Processes text files, downloads videos/PDFs, handles user interactions
- **modules/**: Contains all bot logic and handlers
  - `main.py`: Main bot entry point
  - `text_handler.py`: Handles text file processing
  - `html_handler.py`: HTML conversion features
  - `drm_handler.py`: DRM video handling
  - `youtube_handler.py`: YouTube download functionality
  - `commands.py`, `features.py`, `settings.py`, etc.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Variables
You need to set up the following environment variables in the Replit Secrets:

**Required:**

**For Classplus/DRM Support:**
- **Note**: The Classplus token (`cptoken`) in `modules/globals.py` expires periodically and needs to be updated manually when it expires. If you see errors about "Invalid response - token may be expired", you'll need to get a fresh Classplus token.
